This project gave me an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users are love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

####What I Learned?

Through this project, I:

    * Understood the fundamentals of Android design.
    * Applied Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
    * Separated an interface into surfaces.
    * Effectively used transitions and motion.
